# Escape the Glitch

**Escape the Glitch** is a retro-style 2D puzzle adventure game where you play as a trapped data sprite trying to escape a broken and glitched computer system. Navigate through challenging puzzles, avoid corrupted enemies, and find the exit to each level.

This game is built purely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** â€” no images or external assets, just code and creativity.
